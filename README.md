# 🛠️ Setup Guide

1. **Download and Extract the Repository** 📥  
   First, download the files from the repository and extract them to any location on your system.

2. **Install Python 3.10 or Higher** 🐍  
   Ensure that Python 3.10 or higher is installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. **Install Packages** 🔌  
   Open a Command Prompt (CMD) and run the following command to install all required dependencies: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

4. **Set Up Reverse Proxy (Recommended)** 🔒  
   Since the connection between Winget and the repository only works over HTTPS, it is recommended to set up a reverse proxy (e.g., Apache) in front of the repository for secure communication.

   **Alternative (Not Recommended)** ⚠️  
   If you choose not to set up a reverse proxy, you can use Flask’s built-in web server with HTTPS (though this is not recommended for production). To enable HTTPS on the Flask server, modify the `main.py` file as follows:
   ```python
   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(ssl_context=('SSL/cert.pem', 'SSL/server.pem'))
   ```
   You will also need to create your own SSL certificates using tools like OpenSSL or similar.

6. **Accessing the Repository** 🌐  
   Once everything is set up, you should be able to access Winget-Repo under:
   ```
   https://localhost:5000
   ```
   Or any port you have configured for the server.

# 🔗 Connecting Winget with Winget-Repo

Once the Winget-Repo server is set up and accessible, you can now connect the Winget client to the server. Follow these steps:

1. **Open Command Prompt as Administrator** 🖥️  
   On the client that needs to connect to the Winget-Repo server, open a Command Prompt (CMD) with administrator rights.

2. **Add the Winget-Repo Source** ➕  
   In the Command Prompt, execute the following command:
   ```bash
   winget source add -n Winget-Repo -t "Microsoft.Rest" -a https://{URL of the server}/api/
   ```
   Replace `{URL of the server}` with the actual URL of your Winget-Repo server.

3. **Client authentication** 🔒  
   If client authentication is enabled on the server, include the following parameter: `--header "{'Token': '{ CLIENT_TOKEN }'}"`

   Replace `{CLIENT_TOKEN}` with the client token obtained from Client Management on the server.

   **Note:** The token must be included in every client request.

4. **Confirmation** ✅  
   If the setup is successful, you should see the following message:
   ```
   Source is being added:
     Winget-Repo -> https://{URL of the server}/api/
   Done
   ```

After completing these steps, your Winget-Repo should be ready to serve software and updates to clients within your local network!🎉
